# flyp-automation and scraper

This project is built by Nodejs, and Puppeteer automation library. For client-side Reactjs is used.

Poshmark provides json data for some endpoints, exp: https://poshmark.com/vm-rest/users/mollyskloset
Might not need to build scrape to get user informations but I developed it anyway.

### `node index`
